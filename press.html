		<h2 class="burgundy font-bold">Superman Ultimate Flight Debuts at Six Flags Discover Kingdom</h2>
		<p>VALLEJO - Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel Premier Rides roller coaster at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California.</p>
		  
		<p>Six Flags Discovery Kingdom posted on their official website a picture of a man in front of the building, stating "Can you keep a Secret?", with a hint stating, "It is bigger than a breadbox, smaller than Rhode Island. So get ready for the kind of over-the-top, upside-down, screaming excitement that only Six Flags Discovery Kingdom can offer. On September 1st, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom officially announced Superman Ultimate Flight, a Premier Rides launched roller coaster. Superman Ultimate Fight replaced Pandemonium, a Gerstlauer spinning coaster.</p>
		  
		<p>Superman Ultimate Flight launches out of the station rising up halfway up the first twist. It then returns backwards through the station into the non-inverting loop. Returning forwards and accelerating riders to a top speed of 62 miles per hour (100 km/h). It then travels up to a height of 150 feet (46 m) where it completes a heartline roll (ranking it among the tallest inversions in the world) before exiting in a second non-inverting half-loop at 133 feet (41 m). It then enters the second twist and returns back to the station. The ride can be compared to several of Maurer Söhne's X-Coasters. The non-inverting loop element was previously only found in two of the company's X-Car roller coasters prior to Premier Rides' installation of Superman Ultimate Flight. Additionally, the ride bears several similarities to the SkyLoop model including design, height and speed. On speakers outside the attraction entrance, John Williams&rsaquo; score is played in a loop.</p>
		  
		<p>It&rsquo;s time to find out whether or not Superman Ultimate Flight, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom’s newest thrill ride, would live up to the hype. Is the massive structure, sporting Superman’s trademark blue, red and yellow, worthy of being named after the &ldquo;Man of Steel&rdquo;?</p>
		  
		<p>The initial launch was more than enough to put to rest any doubts about the roller coaster’s thrill factor. Electromagnetic propulsion sends the 12-seat car speeding through a neon-lit tunnel in the shape of the iconic Superman logo.</p>
		  
		<p>&ldquo;It gets you right from the beginning,&rdquo; said Jim Harbaugh, head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, who took the first ride at the media preview Friday. &ldquo;It’s not for the faint of heart.&rdquo;</p>
